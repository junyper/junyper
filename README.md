## **Hello!**

I'm a web developer who gets genuinely excited about making the internet more accessible, one beautifully crafted component at a time. Think of me as part front-end platform engineer, part accessibility champion, and part design systems enthusiast. While my heart belongs to the front end, I'm totally comfortable diving into full-stack and infrastructure territory when the project calls for it.

Outside of work Iâ€™m into gardening, house plants, wrangling my dogs and cats, and spending time with my family.
