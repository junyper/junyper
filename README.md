## **Hello!**

I'm a web developer who gets genuinely excited about making the internet more accessible, one beautifully crafted component at a time. Think of me as part front-end platform engineer, part accessibility champion, and part design systems enthusiast. While my heart belongs to the front end, I'm totally comfortable diving into full-stack and infrastructure territory when the project calls for it.

Outside of work I‚Äôm into gardening, house plants, wrangling my dogs and cats, and spending time with my family.

## **My Greatest Adventure (So Far\!)**

What started as my weekend side project at Instructure became [a suite of core libraries](https://instructure.design/) supporting 7+ product teams and multiple external customers. In just 3 years, I went from tinkering alone to leading a team of 5 brilliant engineers, mentoring teammates across the entire organization, and building accessibility right into the DNA of our components.

The best part? Watching teams ship features faster while making the web more inclusive&mdash;now *that's* what I call a win-win\! 

## **My Exploratory Detour**

[After Instructure](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junyper/), I decided to explore several different corners of the tech world. I dove into front-end architecture, spent some time building developer tooling, doubled down on accessibility advocacy, and eventually found my way back to design systems.

Sure, some roles were shorter than others, but each one taught me something valuable and helped me level up in ways I never expected.

## **What I've Figured Out**

After plenty of coffee, contemplation, and honest conversations with myself, here's what I know for sure:

- **My sweet spot:** I enjoy working on projects that enable product teams to sustainably increase efficiency without impacting quality, and AI-driven solutions are a natural fit here.

- **My ideal playground:** Mid to large companies tackling complex design and engineering challenges at scale. Give me complexity, and I'll give you elegant solutions.

- **Remote ‚â† Isolated:** I believe remote work can be collaborative, connected, and downright delightful when done right. I'm looking for a team with a killer remote culture built on trust, safety, and genuine teamwork.

- **Proactive \> Reactive :** I create the biggest accessibility impact by "shifting left"‚Äîworking shoulder-to-shoulder with designers before problems even become problems.

## **What Gets Me Out of Bed in the Morning**

I'm on the hunt for an individual contributor role where I can geek out with teammates who share the following values:

### üåà Diversity & Inclusion

- **Psychological safety:** Where brilliant ideas flourish because everyone feels safe to think out loud, ask the "stupid" questions, and yes, even admit when they've broken production (we've all been there).

- **Accessibility:** Not just checkboxes and compliance&mdash;I mean the real deal. Building products that welcome everyone and fostering workplaces where every voice matters.

### ü§ù Collaboration

- **True teamwork:** Cross-functional partnerships where designers, product managers, engineers, and stakeholders work together toward shared goals rather than in silos.

- **Shared ownership:** We succeed together, we fail together, we learn together. Teammates support each other, share knowledge openly, and take accountability for both successes and failures.

### üõ†Ô∏è Craft

- **Code that doesn't suck:** Clean, maintainable, well-documented code that doesn't make future developers (including future me) curse my name.

- **Experiences that delight:** Building things that are fast, usable, accessible, and delightful for the humans using them.

### üå± Sustainability

- **Long-term thinking:** Making decisions that future us will thank present us for, even when the pressure is on to ship yesterday.

- **Human-paced productivity:** Moving fast without burning out and maintaining healthy work-life balance.

### üìà Growth

- **Technical leadership:** Space to influence big architectural decisions and lead initiatives that matter.

- **Mentorship magic:** Learning from amazing people and helping others level up too.

- **Creative freedom:** Space to explore innovative solutions, experiment with new technologies, and contribute original ideas that push the boundaries of what's possible.

- **Autonomy:** Trust me to pick the right tools, make smart decisions, and own my projects. I promise I won't let you down.

## **How I Roll as a Leader**

### üöÄ Productivity Multiplier

I don't just write code&mdash;I create systems, tools, and documentation that make entire teams more effective. I lead by example and lift up my teammates, providing support, training, and guidance.

### üåê Systems Thinker

I see the big picture while sweating the details. I'm always balancing today's needs with tomorrow's maintenance burden.

### ü§ù Collaboration Catalyst

I build bridges, foster trust, and turn "us vs. them" into "we've got this together" by encouraging shared ownership. I prefer pairing and swarming to solve problems collaboratively.

### üö¢ Bias for Smart Action

I plan enough to be thoughtful, then I build. I break big scary problems into bite-sized, shippable pieces. I'd rather ship something good today than something perfect never.

### üîÑ Continuous Improvement Enthusiast

Fast feedback loops are my jam. I architect for change because change is the only constant in this business.

## **Current Side Quests**

I believe in continuous growth and transparency about where I'm focusing my personal development efforts. Currently, I'm actively working on leveling up in the following areas:

### üß† Focus and Deep Work

- **Resisting the urge to "fix all the things"**: Learning to ignore that one broken test, the outdated dependency, or the slightly inefficient code when I'm supposed to be working on something more important.

- **Distraction management**: Improving my ability to maintain focus during complex problem-solving sessions and resist interruptions from notifications or tangential tasks.

- **Time blocking**: Implementing more structured approaches to dedicate uninterrupted time blocks for coding, learning, and project development.

### ü§Ø Making Complex Things Simple (Without Dumbing Them Down)

- **Jargon detox program**: Breaking my habit of explaining something simple by using 5 more complex concepts that also need explaining (it's turtles all the way down\!).

- **Patience level-up**: Remembering that my excitement about elegant code solutions doesn't always translate to others, and that's totally okay.

- **Active listening**: Working on catching those moments when someone's confused face means I should pause and check in, not barrel ahead with more explanations.

### üé≠ Emotional Intelligence

- **Self-awareness**: Regularly reflecting on my emotional responses and triggers, particularly in high-pressure situations or when receiving feedback. I'm learning to pause and identify what I'm feeling before reacting.

- **Emotional regulation**: Developing strategies to manage stress and frustration constructively, including taking breaks when needed and reframing challenging situations as learning opportunities.

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions on productivity hacks that have worked well for others. If you notice me doing any of the things I'm trying to improve (like going down a rabbit hole mid-conversation or responding in a way that doesn‚Äôt land well), please call me out\! I genuinely appreciate it when people help me level up.

## **Let‚Äôs Chat\!**

I love talking shop about any of the stuff mentioned above&mdash;whether you want to dive deep into a particular project, swap productivity tips, or just geek out about cool tech. Seriously, ask me about anything\! I'm always up for a good conversation.

Looking forward to connecting\!
